**Who Am I?**

My name is Brandon Cole.

I am passionate about software, and take a particular interest in best practices and software quality.  I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering in 2015.

Adventure is a part of my DNA.  The <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/header_image.jpg" data-lightbox="cover-photo-large" data-title="Glacier National Park - Lake McDonald from Apgar Lookout">cover photo</a> you may have noticed on the home page is a picture I took at [Glacier National Park][glacier] while making a road trip from Rochester, NY to Mountain View, CA for job relocation.  Perhaps someday I’ll make a post on my road trips and other adventures!

**Why did I make this blog?**

You can read my [introduction blog post]({% post_url 2015-09-23-blog-init %}) for my reasoning behind starting this blog.  Overall, though, I hope to keep this an exciting a fun place while also sharing my professional learnings and thoughts.

**What am I doing with my life right now?**

I currently work at Intuit, Inc.

I am not currently seeking employment, but you can always reach out to me at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
